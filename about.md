I am an engineering student at the University of Michigan.  The only think I love to do more than learn is to do.  This doing takes shape in a variety of areas, including music, robots, chess, and others, the stranger the better. This site represents a quick effort to put all my work in the same place, although much of it is still dispersed in various digital and physical storage methods.  Anyway, old material is appended as it is recovered and new material is posted as it is created.

My github account is linked in the footer of any page on this site.  In case you aren't familiar with github, it serves as a storage and distribution system for software.  In fact, this website is stored and hosted on github.
