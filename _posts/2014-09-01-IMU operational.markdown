I finished the Python sensor libraries for the IMU!  Now accel, gyro, and magnetometer values can be collected with an include and commands only a few characters long!  They can be viewed in the [github repository](https://github.com/clharman/IMU-datalogger) for this project.

This means that hardware assembly will soon commence.
