Control Module.  Power input goes to male header pins, which disperse power to PWM outputs (other male headers) and Beaglebone power input (large cable).  Female header pins accept the IMU's wire harness.  Control pins for PWM outputs come from various pins.

Proto board unplugs from Beaglebone, allowing it to be used with other projects

Overall it has a very DIY feel and seems quite sturdy.  I am very pleased.  (Note: this picture was added after its first crash, hence the mauled propeller)
