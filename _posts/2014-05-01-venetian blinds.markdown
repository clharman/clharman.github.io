From 2013-2014 I worked with Professor [Jim Cogswell](http://www.jimcogswell.com/") and [Conor Barry](http://conorbarry.me/) on a large, Arduino-controlled set of Venetian Blinds.  I reworked a good deal of the physical system, added a gear reduction, added sensor mounts, a timing belt, and created an AC motor controller compatible with Arduino.  I also made a [visualizer app](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~clharman/blinds.html) that helped us choose a target speed. A showcase video can be viewed [here](http://vimeo.com/97009924) and an interview of us collaborators can be viewed [here](http://vimeo.com/97661352).  Jim and Conor are both extremely creative guys and working with them was a terrific experience.  Jim is hoping to find a gallery/space in which to exhibit the piece (not so simple -- they are 10 by 10 feet!).
